most react apps are made of components. a component is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance. a component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

react components are javascript functions that return markup.

There are are two ways to create a React App: 
  - We can use, Create react App (CRA)
  - Vite

    -To create an app using vite use, npm create vite@latest or you can npm create vite@4.1.0

    - After creating the project cd to the project folder, next run npm install, finally run npm run dev
